==================

Link from New York Times archive articles to The Times Machine.

This chrome extension makes it possible to link directly to the Times Machine when viewing a current archive landing page or PDF.  For example, if you are reading the Moon Landing front page article "ASTRONAUTS LAND ON PLAIN" at http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=940DE4DB1738E63ABC4951DFB1668382679EDE, the browser icon will be enabled, and will take you to http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1969/07/21/90114388.html where the article can be read in the context of the paper.
